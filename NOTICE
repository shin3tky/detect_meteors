NPF Rule (Nightscape Photography Formula)
================================================================================

The NPF Rule implementation in this software is based on the formula developed by:

  Frédéric Michaud
  Société Astronomique du Havre (SAH)
  https://sahavre.fr/wp/regle-npf-rule/

The NPF Rule provides accurate calculation of maximum exposure time for
astrophotography to capture point-like stars without trailing.

As required by the original author:
"This rule has been developed by Frédéric Michaud (the author) from Society of
Astronomy, Le Havre (SAH) for the use of photographers and amateur astronomers.
Any development using this formula shall give credit to the author and the SAH."
